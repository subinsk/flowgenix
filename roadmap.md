# Flowgenix Engineering Assignment Roadmap

**Figma Design Reference:**
[Assignment--FullStack-Engineer Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/RVtXQB4bzKSlHrtejIQqMH/Assignment--FullStack-Engineer?node-id=0-1&p=f)

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize monorepo or separate repos for frontend and backend
- [x] Set up Docker for frontend, backend, and database
- [x] Configure PostgreSQL database (structure ready, integration pending for workflow/chat logs)
- [x] Set up FastAPI backend skeleton
- [x] Set up Next.js TypeScript frontend with App Router
- [x] Integrate React Flow for drag-and-drop workflow builder
- [x] Custom theme integration with extracted color palette

## Phase 2: Core Backend Features
- [x] Document upload endpoint (FastAPI)
- [x] Text extraction using PyMuPDF
- [x] Embedding generation (Gemini API embeddings)
- [x] Store/retrieve embeddings in ChromaDB
- [x] LLM interaction endpoint (Gemini API, placeholder)
- [x] Pluggable web search integration (Brave and SerpAPI, switchable at runtime, UI ready)
- [x] Workflow execution engine (orchestrate components, basic chat logic)
- [x] Store workflow definitions in PostgreSQL (implemented with SQLAlchemy, real DB integration complete)
- [x] Store chat logs in PostgreSQL (implemented with SQLAlchemy, real DB integration complete)

## Phase 3: Core Frontend Features
- [x] Component library panel (User Query, KnowledgeBase, LLM Engine, Web Search, Output)
- [x] React Flow canvas for workflow building with drag-and-drop
- [x] Component configuration panel (dynamic forms for selected components)
- [x] Execution controls (Build Stack, Chat with Stack, Save/Load workflows)
- [x] Chat interface for workflow interaction with message history
- [x] Validation of workflow structure with status indicators
- [x] UI for selecting and switching between Brave and SerpAPI web search providers
- [x] Document upload component with progress indicators
- [x] Status bar with workflow validation and build information
- [x] Custom shadcn/ui theme with extracted color palette

## Phase 4: Integration & Validation
- [x] Connect frontend to backend APIs (API client utilities created)
- [x] Validate workflow execution end-to-end (real-time execution system implemented)
- [x] Error handling and user feedback (loading states, status messages)
- [x] UI/UX polish (Figma reference colors and modern design)

## Phase 5: Advanced/Optional Features
- [x] Workflow saving/loading (DB integration complete)
- [x] Chat history persistence (DB integration complete)
- [x] User authentication (frontend and backend complete)
- [x] Protected routes and auth context
- [x] API services integration
- [x] Execution logs and real-time progress (WebSocket-based progress tracking implemented)
- [x] Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) (complete with custom dashboards and metrics)
- [x] Logging (ELK Stack) (complete with structured logging and centralized collection)
- [x] Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts (complete with full K8s deployment)

## Phase 6: Documentation & Demo
- [x] Write comprehensive README with setup/run instructions
- [x] Create detailed START.md with development guide
- [x] Environment configuration and Docker setup
- [x] Troubleshooting guide and common issues
- [x] Architecture diagram/flowchart (comprehensive text-based diagram created)
- [ ] Record video demo or screen recording (pending)
